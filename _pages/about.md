I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Mathematics at Boise State University. I have earned a Ph.D. In Engineering (Scientific Computing) from the University of Warwick, UK in 2011. I have then moved to the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, CA as a National Research Council Postgraduate Fellow. I have held a Visiting Fellow position at the Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences in Cambridge, UK, and was an Assistant Researcher at the University of California, Santa Cruz.

I am interested in computational and applied mathematics, specifically numerical methods for ocean modeling, high performance scientific computing, computational fluid dynamics, adaptive mesh refinement, and scientific software development. I use element-based Galrking methods (Finite Elements, Spectral Elements, Discontinuous Galerkin).
