Last weekend, I had the pleasure of seeing several of our Ph.D. in Computing students represent Boise State at the 5th Biennial Meeting of the Pacific Northwest Section of SIAM, hosted in Seattle.
Our group included Patricia Azike, Olayemi Adeyemi, Demond Boateng, Sandra Babyale, Denis Mulumba, Dave Johnson, Stanley Akor, Antone Chacartegui, Agnes Namyalo, Nathan Sundquist, and Tapiwa Mwila.

The students gave excellent talks and poster presentations on their doctoral research, covering topics that spanned from smoke concentration modeling to machine learning applications in scientific computing. It was inspiring to see their work generate such interest and thoughtful discussion among attendees from across the Pacific Northwest.

I was especially proud to see Olayemi (Yemi) Adeyemi recognized with an Outstanding Poster Presentation Award for her poster titled “High-Order Galerkin vs. Traditional Methods: A Multi-Resolution Atmospheric Modeling.”
As one of Yemi’s advisors, along with Antone Chacartegui—who also presented his research at the meeting—I was thrilled to see both contributing so strongly to the visibility and reputation of our program.


Overall, Boise State was well represented at the meeting, and our students’ professionalism and enthusiasm reflected beautifully on the Ph.D. in Computing program and the Mathematics Department.
