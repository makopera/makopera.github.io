One of the most rewarding aspects of my job is witnessing students rise to the challenge of applying their knowledge to solve real-world problems. This year, Boise State students Antonio Cariello and Max Hewes, coached by PhD in Computing graduate student Gus Tropea, did exactly that at [SCUDEM](https://qubeshub.org/community/groups/scudem/overview) (SIMIODE Challenge Using Differential Equations Modeling). Their exceptional teamwork, creativity, and mathematical rigor earned them an *Outstanding Award* for their solution to the "Sweet Tooth and Heavy Metal" problem.

## What is SCUDEM?
SCUDEM is a global competition designed to push students to model complex phenomena using differential or difference equations. Teams have a limited time to develop their models and must present their findings in a 10-minute video for evaluation by a panel of judges. Antonio and Max’s problem of choice was both timely and impactful: they were tasked with modeling how heavy metals in chocolate could accumulate in the human body depending on consumption patterns.

The *Sweet Tooth and Heavy Metal* problem challenged the students to explore the long-term dynamics of heavy metal bioaccumulation, factoring in varying levels of chocolate consumption. They were also asked to consider the unique patterns of children who might binge on candy during holidays or birthdays, exploring how these behaviors might differ based on timing and parental strategies for candy consumption.


## Innovative Modeling by Antonio and Max
Antonio and Max developed a sophisticated model incorporating differential equations to track the accumulation and clearance of heavy metals in the human body. Their work didn’t stop at presenting general trends—they also provided insights into practical questions, such as whether spreading out candy consumption mitigates health risks compared to binge eating. 

This achievement reflects not only Antonio and Max’s talent and dedication but also the exceptional mentorship provided by Gus Tropea. As a graduate student in Boise State’s [PhD in Computing](https://www.boisestate.edu/computing/phd/) program, Gus brought both expertise and enthusiasm to his role as a coach, guiding the team through the modeling process and helping them refine their presentation.

##Celebrating Success and the Power of Mathematics
Competitions like SCUDEM underscore the power of mathematics to tackle pressing real-world challenges. They also provide invaluable opportunities for students to hone their problem-solving skills, collaborate as a team, and communicate their findings effectively. I’m incredibly proud of Antonio, Max, and Gus for their outstanding achievement. Their success is a testament to the strength of Boise State’s students and the importance of fostering hands-on, experiential learning in STEM disciplines.
